        <p>
            Deepawali, commonly known as Diwali, is a Hindu festival widely celebrated in India and other parts of
            the world. It is one of the most important and popular festivals in Hinduism. The word "Diwali" is
            derived from the Sanskrit word "Deepavali," which means a row of lights. The festival usually lasts five
            days and is marked by various rituals, decorations, and the lighting of oil lamps or diyas.
            <br><br>
            Diwali signifies the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. The celebration is associated
            with various mythological stories, the most well-known being the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after
            defeating the demon king Ravana. People celebrate Diwali by cleaning and decorating their homes,
            lighting lamps, bursting fireworks, exchanging gifts, and preparing festive meals.

        <P>
            Diwali, or Deepawali, is celebrated for various reasons, and the significance may vary among different
            regions and communities. Here are some of the common reasons and themes associated with the celebration of
            Diwali:
            <br><br>
            1. <b>Victory of Light over Darkness:</b> Diwali symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over
            evil. This theme is often associated with the legend of Lord Rama, who returned to his kingdom of Ayodhya
            after defeating the demon king Ravana. The people of Ayodhya lit oil lamps to welcome him back, and this
            tradition is believed to be the origin of the custom of lighting lamps during Diwali.
            <br><br>
            2. <b>Goddess Lakshmi's Blessings:</b> Diwali is also dedicated to the worship of Goddess Lakshmi, the Hindu
            goddess of wealth and prosperity. It is believed that Goddess Lakshmi visits homes that are clean and
            well-lit, bringing prosperity and good fortune. People pray for her blessings and wealth during Diwali.
            <br><br>
            3. <b>New Year in some regions:</b> In some parts of India, Diwali marks the beginning of the new year.
            People
            clean and decorate their homes, buy new clothes, and make offerings to start the year on an auspicious note.
            <br><br>
            4. <b>Celebration of Relationships:</b> Diwali is a time for families to come together, exchange gifts, and
            celebrate their relationships. It is a time of joy, unity, and strengthening familial bonds.
            <br><br>
            5. <b>Cultural and Social Significance:</b> Diwali is not only a religious festival but also holds cultural
            and
            social significance. It is a time when people decorate their homes, create intricate rangoli designs,
            exchange sweets, and participate in various cultural events and festivities.

        <p>
            The celebration of Diwali involves several rituals and customs that vary across different regions and
            communities. Here is a general overview of the common procedures and practices associated with Diwali:<br>

            1.<b>Decoration:</b> Weeks before Diwali, people clean and decorate their homes. Cleaning
            symbolizes the removal of negativity and the preparation for the arrival of Goddess Lakshmi. Homes are
            decorated with colorful rangoli (artistic patterns made on the floor), diyas (oil lamps), candles, and
            electric lights.<br>

            2.<b>Shopping:</b> Diwali is a time for shopping, and people buy new clothes, jewelry, and household items.
            It
            is considered auspicious to make significant purchases during this time.<br>

            3.<b>Dhanteras:</b> Diwali festivities often begin with Dhanteras, which falls two days before Diwali. On
            this
            day, people worship Lord Dhanvantari (the physician of the gods) and Goddess Lakshmi. It is also customary
            to buy gold, silver, or new utensils on Dhanteras.<br>

            4.<b>Choti Diwali/Narak Chaturdashi:</b> The day before Diwali is known as Choti Diwali or Narak
            Chaturdashi.
            It commemorates the victory of Lord Krishna over the demon Narakasura. People take an oil bath before
            sunrise, light lamps, and burst fireworks.<br>

            5.<b>Main Diwali Day:</b> On the day of Diwali, people wake up early, take a ritual oil bath, and wear new
            clothes. In the evening, families gather for Lakshmi Puja, a worship ceremony dedicated to Goddess Lakshmi.
            The puja involves lighting lamps, offering prayers, and seeking the blessings of the goddess for prosperity
            and wealth. Many people also worship Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles, during this time.<br>

            6.<b>Fireworks and Lighting:</b> The night of Diwali is associated with the bursting of fireworks. The idea
            is
            to drive away evil spirits with the noise and light. However, in recent years, there has been a growing
            awareness of the environmental impact of fireworks, leading some people to opt for more eco-friendly
            celebrations.<br>

            7.<b>Exchanging Gifts and Sweets:</b> Families and friends exchange gifts and sweets as a symbol of love and
            goodwill. It is a time for strengthening relationships and expressing gratitude.<br>

            8.<b>Feasting:</b> Diwali is a time for delicious food. Families prepare special meals and sweets, and the
            feasting continues throughout the festival.<br>
